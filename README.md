# ETL-Hive
Introduction ETL with HIVE  ===========  Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) programs process data from sources into data warehouses (DWs). Due to the rapid growth of data volumes, there is an increasing demand for systems that can scale on demand. Recently, much attention has been given to MapReduce which is a framework for highly parallel handling of massive data sets in cloud environments. The MapReduce-based Hive has been proposed as an RDBMS-like system for DWs and provides good and scalable analytical features.
